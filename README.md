# ProjectA1
Initialize  new repository for Git hub.

I am a jr. developer currently looking for employment. I am interested to see where the coding world will lead me,
especially since the community around web and software development is becoming more and more based around team efforts.
I look forward to learning as much as I can as I find my way in this new career.
